The tutorial will provide a basic overview of research methodology, bioinformatic tools and modelling, and their implementation in Systems Medicine. The hands-on approaches will train you how to apply these principles to your own work and studies while the lectures will provide an insight into the Systems Medicine Success Stories.

We encourage applications by everyone with a basic knowledge in biomedicine or bioinformatics (undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students).
The number of participants is limited to 20 on the "first come, first serve" basis.
The certificates of ECTS credits will be provided upon the final examination.
